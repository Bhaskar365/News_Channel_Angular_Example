            have been displaced by floods caused in recent weeks by torrential rains 
            in the Horn of Africa, the NGO Save the Children announced on Thursday.
            The El Ni√±o climatic phenomenon is amplifying the rainy season in the region, 
            affecting Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya in particular.Incessant rainfall in Kenya's 
            northern counties and capital Nairobi has caused widespread flooding, displacing 
            an estimated 36,000 people and killing 46 since the rainy season began less than a 
            month ago, " said Save the Children in a statement, adding that 32 people had also 
            died in Somalia and 33 in Ethiopia. The British NGO also urged the international 
            community to take action in response to massive displacement in all three countries.`,

            displaced, and more than 2.8 million have been impacted, according to 
            UN estimates, as farmlands and infrastructure have been submerged.
            Floodwaters in northeast Nigeria have swept through sites for internally 
            displaced people and host community villages in Borno, Adamawa, and Yobe States, 
            forcing people to higher ground. UNHCR and partners have been providing shelter 
            and essential aid to thousands of families, including 14,900 tarpaulin sheets and 
            550 kits with basic household items. In Taraba State, heavy rain has cut off affected 
            communities in Baissa town from humanitarian assistance.`,

             many people were still without power or drinking water several days after the waters 
             began to recede (AfricaNews, 2022).More than 440 people are known to have died, 
             with the search continuing for a further 63 people reported missing at the time 
             of writing. Mudslides as well as swollen rivers were responsible for many of these 
             deaths (BBC, 2022a). Search and rescue operations being run from Virginia Airport in 
             Durban were still sending out teams on Sunday 24 April to search for missing people 
             thought to have been swept away by the floods (Durban Mercury, 2022).`,
